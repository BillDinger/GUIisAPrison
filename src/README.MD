This directory contains the `inventory` files used by the solution as well as our `ansible.cfg`. These inventory files contain the GCP settings we need and resources we can manage. The `playbooks` directory contains the various playbooks we used to setup our GCP systems while the `vars` directory contains variables we can use in our playbooks.
